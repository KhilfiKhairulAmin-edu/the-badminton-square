                            <h2>Low Injury Rate</h2>
                            <p>
                                Badminton is a non-contact sport, making it a lot safer than most contact sports. You don’t have to be supremely fit to start playing the game, and the intensity of the game is determined by the level of the players.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As such, badminton players have a much lower injury rate compared to other sportsmen. This means you can play this game on a regular basis without taking time off to heal from an injury.

                            <h2>Lesser Players</h2>
                            <p>
                                If you’re familiar with sports like football or hockey, you’ll see that each of these games requires at least 5 people on a team. And most of the time, it’s difficult to find ten people with free schedules, willing to come out and play.
                            </p>

                                On the other hand, you only need two players to play badminton, and it’s a lot easier to find a willing opponent.

                            <h2>Indoor Sport</h2>
                            <p>
                                One of the most important aspects of badminton, and the reason why it’s the second-favourite sport in India is that it is played indoors.

                                Playing badminton outdoors is difficult, if not impossible because even a slight breeze can cause the shuttlecock to move unpredictably. So to prevent the elements from hindering the game, this sport is played indoors all the time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So even if it’s raining in your area, you can simply head over to a badminton court and play a game or two. And in a country like India, where the weather is quite unpredictable, an indoor sport is a great way to spend time.

                                For badminton, all you need is a racket, a shuttlecock, and a court to play on. Professional badminton rackets and shuttles are quite expensive to buy. However, you’re sure to find inexpensive shuttlecocks and rackets in various sports stores across the country.

                                As for the badminton court, there are many badminton clubs and sports institutions where you can play a game of badminton for a very small fee.
